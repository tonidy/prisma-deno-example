# Deno 2 + Prisma

This code is based on the following tutorials:

- [Deno and Prisma Example](https://docs.deno.com/examples/prisma_tutorial)
- [Deploying Prisma Client on Deno Deploy](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-client/deployment/edge/deploy-to-deno-deploy)

The main change I made is replacing the use of [Prisma Accelerate](https://www.prisma.io/accelerate) with a local database connection.
